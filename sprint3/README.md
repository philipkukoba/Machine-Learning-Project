# Sprint 3 - group 25

The main notebook is Sprint_3_Intro_and_Task_2_and_3.ipynb. This notebook contains the introduction and task 2/3. Because there was a lot of computing power needed to execute the tasks, we decided to move to Google Colab. That also means that the other tasks are executed in individual notebooks.

A list of what is in this file structure:
* Sprint_3_Intro_and_Task_2_and_3.ipynb: Introduction and task 2/3.
