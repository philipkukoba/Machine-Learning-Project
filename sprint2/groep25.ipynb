    "### Keyword extraction using TextRank\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Word2vec seems to be working well, we would like to use its power for keyword extraction. Herefor we choose a TextRank implementation which relies on a trained word2vec model. TextRank is a graph-based ranking model for text processing, commonly used for keyword extraction and text summarization. It sets up a graph structure with words as nodes and edges for related words. Each word is connected to other words that are close to it in the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "The more connected a word is, the higher its weight. This is done with the TextRank algorithm. Each node is given a weight of 1. Then the algorithm iterates the list of nodes and collects the influence of each of its inbound connections, this is usually just the value of the connected vertex and then summed up to determine the new score for the node. Then the scores are normalised so the highest score becomes 1 and the rest is scaled from 0 to 1. This is repeated until the values stop changing. \n",
